Hi
I am running a pipeline as below.

udpsrc --> gstrtpbin (latency=40) --(pad)-->>queue
-->rtpdemux-->rtpspeexdepay-->directsoundsink (sync=false qos=true
buffer-time=80000 latency-time=20000)

Once I start running the pipeline there is a delay in recieving the audio.
If I restart the pipeline the delay vanishes. At this point if I congest the
network the delay starts creeping in. But restarting the pipe the delay
vanishes again. It seems the data flow resumes normal levels once the
congestion is over but the pipeline is forever delayed.

My question is how do I resynchronize the pipeline to remove the delay? Or
how do I know if a delay has occured in the pipeline.?

Set sync=true. With sync=false, it just plays whatever whenever.
