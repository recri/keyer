## this script launches a simple SDR radio
##
## the first assumption is that a Softrock Ensemble II is attached
## to this computer through a soundcard attached as hw:1
##
RFDEV=hw:1			# the rf soundcard
RFRATE=96000			# the rf sample rate
RFBUFFER=1024			# the jack buffer size

## launch jackd to process the rf
jackd -T -s -dalsa -C$RFDEV -P$RFDEV -r$RFRATE -p$RFBUFFER -n3 > rfjackd.log 2>&1 &
exit 0
##
## the second assumption is that you want to listen to the radio through
## the onboard soundcard attached as hw:0
##
AFDEV=hw:0			# the af soundcard
AFQUAL=0			# the quality of samplerate conversion
## launch alsa_in
alsa_out -d$AFDEF -q$AFQUAL > afalsa_out.log 2>&1 &

##
## we could simply connect the rf input to the af output, but the signals
## are at -100 dB, so you won't hear much, so we'll add a gain widget to
## boost the signals up
##
gain --min-gain -30 --max-gain 100

##
## and we add a panadapter display
