* OpenGL has direct rendering access to the screen framebuffer
  so if you draw a waterfall with opengl, you can skip a lot of the
  buffer to buffer to buffer copying that happens with higher level
  windowing systems.
** Need to set up a 2D projection
   This one, which is typical, sets the OpenGL coordinate system so 1
   unit in OpenGL world coordinates corresponds to one pixel on the
   screen.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   glMatrixMode (GL_PROJECTION);
   glLoadIdentity ();
   gluOrtho2D (0, windowWidth, 0, windowHeight);
   #+END_EXAMPLE
** Then draw a row (or column) of pixels for the waterfall
   A collection of points, drawn at pixel centers, i+0.5,j+0.5.
** When it's time to draw the next row (or column)
   translate the existing image, all of it, one row down (column left)
   and then delete the row (or column) that scrolled off the window.
