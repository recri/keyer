* Reading the RadCom series on SDR
  by Steve Ireland VK6VZ and Phil Harman VK6APH
* They give the following demodulation formulae in January 2007
** PM = arctan2(Q, I)
** FM = (q[t] i[t-1] - q[t-1] i[t]) / (q[t] q[t-1] + i[t] i[t-1])
* The FM computation is a lot more reasonable than the PLL that DTTSP uses.
