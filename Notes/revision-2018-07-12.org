** Gladish and Claudia stopped reading all my saved ladish projects.
** Installing Claudia puts my packages into an unrecoverable state.

** Jack has promulgated its own session api, which seems more sensible.
** dbus wrappers clog up everything to enable the Ladish session managers
   which stopped loading my saved projects, and haven't successfully saved
   or restored a project this week.
