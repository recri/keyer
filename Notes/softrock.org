* Reduce the gain on the softrock output amp
  Using the sdr-widget with a softrock can be improved by reducing the
  gain on the output op amps.

  Replacing 4k99 with 499 (or matched 470)
  on the RX Ensemble II at R32 and R33.
  on the RXTX Ensemble at R56 and R59.
  In all cases, the feedback resistors from op amp output to inverting
  input.
* Match the BS170's on the TX amp
  The BS170's in the output stage of the RXTX Ensemble are often all
  over the place in their specs, but they're cheap so buy a bunch and
  pick your own matched pairs.
