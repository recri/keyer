  Using the sdr-widget with a softrock can be improved by reducing the
  gain on the output op amps.

  Replacing 4k99 with 499 (or matched 470)
  on the RX Ensemble II at R32 and R33.
  on the RXTX Ensemble at R56 and R59.
  In all cases, the feedback resistors from op amp output to inverting
  input.
