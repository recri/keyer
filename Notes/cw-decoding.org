* MRP40
** 30Hz bandpass filter
** automatic level control
** automatic frequency tracking
** automatic speed detection
* CW Skimmer
** a high sensitivity CW decoding algorithm based on the methods
   of Bayesian statistics;
** simultaneous decoding of ALL cw signals in the receiver passband
   - up to 700 signals can be decoded in parallel on a 3-GHz P4 if a
     wideband receiver is used;
** a fast waterfall display, with a resolution sufficient for reading
   Morse Code dots and dashes visually;
** the callsigns are extracted from the decoded messages, and the
   traces on the waterfall are labeled with stations' callsigns;
** the extracted callsigns are exported as DX cluster spots via the
   built-in Telnet cluster server;
** a DSP processor with a noise blanker, AGC, and a sharp,
   variable-bandwidth CW filter;
** an I/Q Recorder and player.
