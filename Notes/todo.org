* Things to Do
** TODO - update README.org so it's current with the code.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** TODO - Find the common sdrctl/control functionality.
   That which all controllees in sdrui, sdrblk, and sdrctl will share,
   and implement it once.
** TODO - sdrctl/controllees should register the "true" names.
   Those of the controls which they define and not know what exists
   beyond that except as informed.
** TODO - implement -alternates at-most-one, exactly-one, zero-or-more.
   Do this by passing the constraint into the controller and letting
   it enforce it.
** TODO - sdrui/controllees should attach themselves to the "true" names.
   Only those that they inform and are informed by, all the other
   connections should be the responsibility of other controls.
** TODO - sdrblk/controllees should attach to the controls which they need.
** TODO - can the jack port structure of the sdrblk controls be represented
   with the control ports used by sdrui/sdrctl?  Well, we can
   certainly 
** TODO - the sdrblk gets renamed to sdrdsp.
** TODO - the sdrkit directory becomes dspmath, with a dspmath.h
** TODO - the jack-tcl-wrap directory becomes sdrtcl
** TODO - add the libusb interface necessary to handle softrock-dg8saq
   directly from Tcl.
** TODO - add the modified Togl which implements enough canvas like functions
   to redo the spectrum and waterfall and meters in gl.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
** TODO - get the gain controls correct,
   they should be implementing dB of power ratios by adjusting
   the linear magnitude of voltage signals.  Absolute levels
   should be referenced dBFS, full scale, so to the power of a sine
   wave that touches +1 and -1 peak-to-peak, 0.775 RMS.
** TODO - figure out where the bad values in duelling oscillators come from
** TODO - get networked audio from the softrock
** TODO - build the input stage for the radio
   iq correct with visual metering and adaptive mu, panoramic display,
** TODO - interface with hamlib for rig control
** TODO - build an adaptive adaptive filter IQ corrector
   Increases mu to increase convergence when the filter is adapting, then
   decreases mu to refine convergence when the filter has found the vicinity
   of the solution.
** TODO - figure out how to share a jack client connection among the
   commands that aren't jack clients but sometimes need to find a jack
   data item?  NO!  Make them require the sample rate as a parameter,
   so they don't use the wrong one in multi-rate setup.
** TODO - make all the components consistent with evolving conventions.
   This is a tough one since I haven't finished evolving the conventions.
** TODO - factor pileup so it can be used as a signal generator
** TODO - check that command deletion cleans up object valued options
   or make a framework function to deal with it.
** TODO - check that failed configure doesn't lose object valued options
   The save = opts; if fail then opts = save pattern doesn't deal with
   ref counts; the options handler may have decr'ed the saved option
   that we're trying to restore.
** TODO - fft/filter windows are tricky
   the fftw holds a window type and rebuilds the window to the new size, but
   it should take a window as parameter to the fftw exec.  A FIR needs a window
   to build, and would need one to resize.
   Maybe fftw/filter size/window should be create only?
** TODO - test for memory leaks.
** TODO - keyer_binaural.c: to spread a monoaural audio spectrum out spatially
   using DJ5IL's CodePhaser circuit.
** TODO - keyer timing: protect against 0 clocks in all possibilities
** TODO - keyer-scope: graticule doesn't track scrolling
** TODO - keyer-scope: time-scale and audio track canvases don't track
   the coordinates with the midi signal canvases after zoom and scroll.
** TODO - MidiKey: to support the AdaFruit atmega32u4breakout.
** TODO - convert all jack SDR modules to take parameters via MIDI sysex
** TODO - build a character trie to decode sysex parameter settings.
** TODO - keyer_detone.c: to convert keyed cw into midi note on/off events.
** TODO - keyer-control: build, save, and restore custom configurations.
** TODO - keyer-control: ascii input/output window
** TODO - keyer-control: jack launching panel.
** TODO - keyer-control: jack connection panel.
** TODO - jack-control: jack connection panel with modular grouping
   hide/show whole blocks of connections.
** TODO - multi-channel midi-tap, transpose signals to non-overlapping
   channel/note assignments.
** TODO - multi-channel audio-tap
** TODO - operational cartoon of keyer, layout the module connection
   graph and animate the states of signals on the connections between
   them.
** TODO - keyer-control: offer to launch mouse-key
** TODO - sdrkit_jack.c: provide missing jack status information.
** TODO - bin/invaders: callsign-invaders ear/key training game.
** TODO - keyer_skimmer.c: to identify active frequencies in passband and start keyer_detone -> keyer_decode -> ascii.
