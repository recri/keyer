I just wrote filename/procedurename and
thought of having the ability to run parts of scripts
just like that from the shell command line.
Earlier thinking of being in a text file and
having earlier lines structured as name: value
being accessible as variables ${name} like.

There are dozens of scripting languages in use
which could be parsed on the fly and mounted
to extend the file system to see the structured
data of the file as functions and variables and
classes.

Tcl is particularly easy to see this way as a
shell extension, since the syntax of Tcl matches
much of the shell syntax.
