* Portable operation notes
  Took my Ensemble RX II on vacation, got annoyed with all sorts of
  unanticipated problems. 
** Convert softrock Ensemble RX II to USB power
   See softrock.org notes for pointer to instructions.  The extra
   power brick was weight and volume I could do without, and when I
   went to set up the kit, there was only one outlet.
** Multi-tap converter/extension cord
   More cords probably not a good idea, but one of those 3/1
   sockets/plug multi-tap adapters would have been helpful.  Not that
   I want multiple power supplies.
** Make an easily managed dipole
   Use lightweight coax, a robust feed line to dipole connection, and
   wires that aren't going to break, possibly a collection of wires
   that bolt onto the feed line connector.
** Enough cable to keep the sound card separate from the radio.
   Seemed that proximity to the radio prevented the sound card from
   booting.
