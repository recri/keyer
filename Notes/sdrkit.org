** heroku.com
   where you upload a complete web application as a git repo and it

** toto
   a git based blogging platform which maintains blog articles in
   markdown'ed text files.

** Amazon S3 for asset storage
   Rather than bundling large downloadable files, executables and
   video tutorials, with the web application, it's suggested that they
   be stored on Amazon S3 and the download requests be forwarded to
   there for satisfaction.
