* Overlap Save/Overlap Add
  There comes a time in every finite impulse response filter's life
  when it becomes better to be implemented in the frequency domain.
  At that point, you fft the filter kernel and run it as an overlap
  save or overlap add filter.
** Testing the sdrkit overlap save filter.
   First it didn't appear to work, then Jack was disabling it, so I
   assumed it was broken in some way, too slow or crashing.
   I wrote test/test-ovsv.c to run the filter outside of Jack, and it
   appears to run quite satisfactorily.
   |--------+----------------|
   | filter |    seconds per |
   | length | 192000 samples |
   |--------+----------------|
   |    128 |      0.0057600 |
   |    256 |      0.0055488 |
   |    512 |      0.0057408 |
   |   1024 |      0.0059520 |
   |   2048 |      0.0063168 |
   |   4096 |      0.0075072 |
   |   8192 |      0.0079680 |
   |--------+----------------|
   So it runs without faults, whether it's computing the correct
   output remains to be seen.
   And it runs fast enough to be a jack module.
