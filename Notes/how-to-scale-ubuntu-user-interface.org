This release of Tcl/Tk on a high resolution monitor is very hard to read.

I've set the UI scaling to 275% in the system settings>devices>display and
most of Gnome is honoring that scaling, but Tk is drawing microscopic indicators
on radiobutton and checkbutton menu entries.  I've hacked the ttk::radiobutton and
ttk::checkbutton to increase -indicator-radius, and that works for the buttons, but
I need to know what the scaling is set to on the current system or I'll blow up the
UI on a low resolution device.

There used to be a value:
	dconf get /com/ubuntu/user-interface/scaling-factor
which was an integer scale in units of 8th's, but that directory no longer exists
for dconf.

People have pointed to:
	gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor
as the gnome equivalent, but that returns a 0 on my system.
