* Goertzel filters - a way to compute one bin of an arbitrary FFT
  with one multiply and two adds per sample.
** specify frequency of bin
   the center frequency of the bin you wish to compute
** specify bandwidth of bin
   both the width of the bin and the frequency at which results
   are produced.
** know the sample rate of the signal
** sample rate / bandwidth = block length
   we compute the Goertzel filter over block length samples
*** so a 100Hz bandwidth at 48000Hz sample rate requires
    480 samples.
