* Here I am thinking of how to make it over again
** The current structure is failing to operate,
   it's broken somewhere and I haven't found the problem.
** It's hard to wire together
** I want to separate the controllers from the computation
** I want the details of blocks to disappear from the flow graph
** There's a conflict between starting up jackd and not starting
   until you know what you're doing.
