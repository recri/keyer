* The real issue is how to get the right antenna connected
** How about a dipole that adjusts its length
   The basic manpack dipole consists of feedline, center adapter, two
   lengths of wire wound on shuttles, and two lengths of rope wound on
   shuttles.
   To set it you unwind the rope from the shuttles, unwind the wires
   to the correct lengths, and tie the ropes up to suspend the wire to
   height.
   Now, replace the shuttles with microprocessor controlled spools.
   Unwind the rope, tie the rope up to suspend everything at height,
   and now instruct the spools to unwind their wires along the
   suspended rope, taking up the slack in the ropes as they go.
