* jack-1.9.8 difficulties
** requires dbus to start
   awkward for headless machines because DISPLAY is required
   and DISPLAY is used to make an X11 call.
** only one client per process
   If I open a jack client connection to the default server
   and then open a jack client connection to a named server
   that isn't the default server, then both clients end up
   connected to the default server.  Reverse the order of
   the opens and both clients end up connected to the named
   server.
   Is there a reason for only allowing a process to connect
   to only one server?
   Or is it a one client per thread restriction?
** MIDI is treated asymmetrically
   -driver alsa allows MIDI and PCM device import
   audioadapter only allows PCM import
   -driver net allows MIDI and PCM device import
   netadapter only allows PCM import
** celt only allows some sample rates
   it works with -- oh, it's probably a celt version problem
** trouble resampling from 8kHz to 48kHz
   when I use audioadapter to add hw:0 to a net slaved
   jackd running at 8kHz, I get outputs with indeterminate
   latency, with echoes, which are dropped, and outputs which
   are truncated in time.

** cannot run jack net master and client on same machine
   the minimum configuration is two machines
   but the mechanism of connecting through a
   network interface could work on one machine
   and that would mean that multi-server configurations
   could be redistributed over machines without needing
   to be rewritten when they end up on one machine.
