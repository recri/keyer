* Not Pinned Out, but maybe needed
** RX - /QSD EN - detector enable
** RXTX - extra LPF enable
** RX - transmit - route LO through BPF 
   and on to amplifier and LPF
* Other Teensy Pins maybe of use, so don't preempt

* Insert DG8SAQ firmware into USB Stack
  Possible on all atmega32u4.
  Teensy USB stack catches the control requests.
  Just need to forward to a version of the firmware
  that doesn't directly drive the wrong pins
* Alternative, use Arduino Leonardo
** Add a shield that covers the additional functions:
*** DIP connection to replace ATTiny
*** Key input that doesn't share pins with I2C
*** Rotary encoder/track ball/joy stick
*** Additional buttons for PTT, etc    
*** LEDs for feedback
*** LCD for feedback
** Software
*** Incorporate ATTiny/DG8SAQ firmware
    as part of Arduino USB stack
*** Implement MIDI event alternative
    interface to Softrock/Si570 functions
*** Add MIDI event interface to
**** Key input
**** Rotary encoder/track ball/joy stick
**** Additional buttons
**** LED feedback
**** LCD feedback
