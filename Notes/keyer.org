* The recri keyer as of 2018-07-30
  The keyer components have been resuscitated at the urging
  of Chuck Vaughn (aa0hww).  When last Chuck contacted me
  the keyer components were being managed by ladish, the
  linux audio session manager.  This turned out to be a mistake
  as all the session managers have pretty much withered away.
** The script that starts the keyer is ~/keyer/bin/keyer
   It does not of itself start anything at all, the keyer
   you get depends on what you ask it to start.  
** ~/keyer/bin/keyer -start ad5dz
   this command line
