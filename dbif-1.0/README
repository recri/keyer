About
-----

DBus-Intf is a Tcl library for easily providing an introspectable DBus
interface to Tcl programs. It supports the following standard DBus interface
specifications: org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer, org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties,
and org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable


Features
--------

   + Provide introspection of methods, signals, and properties.

   + Support org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get, Set, and GetAll calls.

   + Respond to org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer.Ping requests.


Compiling
---------

The dbus-intf package is plain Tcl. A TEA3-based build system is provided for
building the manual page and installing the package. Installing the package
generally consists of running "./configure; make; make install" in the
top-level directory. More details are available in the INSTALL file.

*** NOTE ***

Building the documentation requires the availability of the dtplite command,
which is part of the doctools package in tcllib.
