* MIDI enabled morse code keying
** These sketches and PCB designs enable a morse code key or paddle
   that generates MIDI NoteOn/NoteOff events.  Other parts of
   https://github.com/recri/keyer implement keyers that are triggered
   by MIDI events and generate sidetones, keying signals, and IQ baseband
   signals.
** The sketches all run on various Teensy processors available from
   https://www.pjrc.com/ and other sources.  They
** MidiKey - runs on a Teensy 2.0, it takes input through a 1/8" stereo
   audio jack from a straight key or paddle and generates MIDI NoteOn's
   when keys or paddles close, and MIDI NoteOff's when they open.  It was
   built on perfboard with wirewrap connecting header pins.
** MidiKeyTB - extension to MidiKey which adds a Blackberry Trackball Breakout
   (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/13169) which can still be found
   for sale on Ebay even though SparkFun has retired it.
** MidiKeySR - extension to MidiKey which added Softrock control features,
   a work still in progress several years later.
** LufaMidiKey - implemented the MidiKey using the LUFA libraries.
   This worked as a proof of concept, but hasn't been used in many years.
** MidiKeyTouch - runs on a Teensy LC or a Teensy 3.0-2, sandwiches the 
   microprocessor between two PCB's with touch pads, and wraps the entire
   package in tube of heatshrink.  Currently under development.
** MidiKeys - runs on a Teensy 3.x or 4.x, allows multiple keys.
   Also supports the "low commitment" midi keyer
   [[../images/low-commitment2.png]]
   which can be built with:
*** a Teensy LC/3.x/4.x from pjrc.com ($11.65 to $22.95)
*** a 10x17 pt mini solderless breadboard (cost depends on quantity)
*** a breadboard friendly stereo jack,
    such as https://www.adafruit.com/product/1699 for $0.95
