* The MidiKey projects
  The whole point is to get CW keying information into the computer
  with the lowest latency possible.  To do that you'll need a
  MIDI-USB-Keyer dongle to hookup your straight key or paddle.

  I started with a paddle interface built on a breadboard from a
  Teensy 2.0 (from http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/), a stereo audio jack,
  and three jumper wires.
| Teensy B0     | -> | stereo jack dit    |
| Teensy B1     | -> | stereo jack dah    |
| Teensy GND    | -> | stereo jack common |
| Iambic paddle | -> | stereo jack        |
| Teensy USB    | -> | computer           |

  The Teensyduino application to translate paddle transitions into
  MIDI events is in MidiKey/MidiKey.ino.  The instructions for building
  it are in the source code.

  I've packaged the keyer dongle into an Altoids Smalls tin, shown
  [[https://github.com/recri/keyer/blob/master/images/keyer-8.jpg][in the tin]], and [[https://github.com/recri/keyer/blob/master/images/keyer-7.jpg][exposed]]. The perf board is supported on 5/8"
  standoffs   of the bottom of the tin.  The Teensy is mounted on
  upside down header pins, short end through the perf board long end
  through the Teensy mounting holes. The Teensy and stereo jack are
  super glued onto the perf board.  The stereo jack lugs are soldered
  to a set of five header pins.  The rest of the connections are
  wire-wrapped between long legs of header pins.

  The set of 11 pins at the left edge of the [[https://github.com/recri/keyer/blob/master/images/keyer-7.jpg][exposed]] image is a
  Sparkfun Blackberry trackball breakout which is unsupported in the
  software at the moment.  You can see the trackball erupting through
  [[https://github.com/recri/keyer/blob/master/images/keyer-8.jpg][the tin]].
  
  In retrospect, I'd switch to using input pins closer to the stereo
  jack end of the Teensy.

  Glen Overby provoked this project on the dttsp list at yahoo back in
  November 2011.  He has built another MIDI key interface which is
  described [[http://reality.sgiweb.org/overby/ham/Equipment/Key-Adapter/index.html][here]]. It should work with this software if the MIDI note
  is set properly.
* MIDI enabled morse code keying
** These sketches and PCB designs enable a morse code key or paddle
   that generates MIDI NoteOn/NoteOff events.  Other parts of
   https://github.com/recri/keyer implement keyers that are triggered
   by MIDI events and generate sidetones, keying signals, and IQ baseband
   signals.
** The sketches all run on various Teensy processors available from
   https://www.pjrc.com/ and other sources.  They
** MidiKey - runs on a Teensy 2.0, it takes input through a 1/8" stereo
   audio jack from a straight key or paddle and generates MIDI NoteOn's
   when keys or paddles close, and MIDI NoteOff's when they open.  It was
   built on perfboard with wirewrap connecting header pins.
** MidiKeyTB - extension to MidiKey which adds a Blackberry Trackball Breakout
   (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/13169) which can still be found
   for sale on Ebay even though SparkFun has retired it.
** MidiKeySR - extension to MidiKey which added Softrock control features,
   a work still in progress several years later.
** LufaMidiKey - implemented the MidiKey using the LUFA libraries.
   This worked as a proof of concept, but hasn't been used in many years.
** MidiKeyTouch - runs on a Teensy LC or a Teensy 3.0-2, sandwiches the 
   microprocessor between two PCB's with touch pads, and wraps the entire
   package in tube of heatshrink.  Currently under development.
** MidiKeys - runs on a Teensy 3.x or 4.x, allows multiple keys.
   Also supports the "low commitment" midi keyer
   [[../images/low-commitment2.png]]
   which can be built with:
*** a Teensy LC/3.x/4.x from pjrc.com ($11.65 to $22.95)
*** a 10x17 pt mini solderless breadboard (cost depends on quantity)
*** a breadboard friendly stereo jack,
    such as https://www.adafruit.com/product/1699 for $0.95
