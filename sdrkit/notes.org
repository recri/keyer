** computing an fft over some window of audio
   could be synchronized with the frame clock
   samples are buffered until frameclock mod fftsize is zero,
   then compute the fft and start buffering the next input
   buffer.
   meanwhile, the results of the previous fft, or second
   previous, could be supplied as output samples.  So the
   audio time domain signal is transformed to an audio freq
   domain signal, which is similarly aligned to the frameclock
   so the time domain makes sense.
