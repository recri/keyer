* sdrkit keyer
  This is a morse code keyer consisting of jack audio connection kit
  plugins.  There's a plugin, keyer_tone, that generates i/q cw tones, a
  plugin, keyer_ascii, that translates ascii text into midi events to
  drive the tone generator, and an iambic keyer plugin, keyer_iambic,
  for translating midi events from an iambic paddle into midi events
  into midi events to drive the tone generator.
** Paddle Interface
   I use a paddle interface built on a breadboard from a Teensy 2.0 (from
   http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/), a stereo audio jack, and three jumper
   wires.  (Teensy B0 -> jack dit, B1 -> dah, GND -> common).  The
   software to make B0 and B1 transmit USB:MIDI is an example program
   installed with the Teensyduino extension to the Arduino development
   package.
** Plugin usage
   To use the plugins is a bit rough at the moment.  You need to start
   them as separate programs, each running in a shell window, and
   then connect them in Qjackctl or some other jack wiring
   interface.  They need to be in shell windows because, at the
   moment, they'll block if you detach them.  I use three separate
   emacs shell windows so I can turn up the verbose option and see
   what's happening in each. 
*** Wiring on Qjackctl
    For wiring I use Qjackctl with jack configured to use the "raw" midi
    interface.
**** On the MIDI panel I connect:
     system -> keyer_iambic
     keyer_iambic -> keyer_tone
     keyer_ascii -> keyer_tone<
**** On the Audio panel I connect:
     keyer_tone -> system
**** On the ALSA panel I don't connect anything
     but I look to see that the Teensy MIDI device is connected.

*** Automation
    All this could be automated with jack_connect, but I have enough half
    tested code as it is.
