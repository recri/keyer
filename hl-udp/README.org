* hl2.tcl - Hermes Lite 2 interface in Tcl
** Hermes Lite 2 is DDC/DDU radio that connects
   to a power supply, a gigabit ethernet, and an
   antenna.
**
## overview
##
# This is built from examination of the source of quisk-4.1.41.
# The hermes lite operates via udp packets over its ethernet.
# Packets received from the hl2 are directed either to endpoint ? 
# and contain bandscope samples or to endpoint ? and contain
# control bytes, received iq samples, and microphone samples.
# Packets sent to the hl2 contain control bytes, transmit iq
# samples, and speaker audio samples.
# The microphone and speaker samples are ignored.
# The control sequences sent and received generally cycle
# through a set of controls over and over.
# Sending a control which alters the sample rate of the iq
# samples received or the number of receivers need special
# treatment so that samples received are not processed
# incorrectly.
# There are special control sequences which specify i2c
# commands on the radio, these are only sent
