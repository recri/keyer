* [x] The radio don't run without the IQ enable bit in the start command.
  guess that's part of the design
* [ ] The Tcl udp doesn't keep up at 4x384
* [ ] rx reset doesn't clear the queue when Tcl udp falls behind
* [x] why am I getting spurious -state settings from overflying
  scale and spinbox in the hl::scale megawidget?
** Because the name of the widget is scale, which is the name
   of a sub-widget, and the sub-widget handler catches the mega widget
   name.
  
* [x] why is my relay chattering when I enable MOX?
  ah, contrary to all the x's in the low bit of every C0 after C0==0,
  every C0 has a MOX bit in that position.
* [ ] first smoke on hl_jack:
   *** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
   Aborted (core dumped)
   guess I was a little sloppy somewhere
